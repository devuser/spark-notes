Create a test to expose the bug¶

What we’ve just done in the shell to test for the problem is exactly what we can do in an automated test, so let’s turn that into an automated test.

A conventional place for an application’s tests is in the application’s tests.py file; the testing system will automatically find tests in any file whose name begins with test.

Put the following in the tests.py file in the polls application:

polls/tests.py import datetime

from django.utils import timezone from django.test import TestCase

from .models import Question

class QuestionModelTests(TestCase):

```

def test_was_published_recently_with_future_question(self): """ was_published_recently() returns False for questions whose pub_date is in the future. """ time = timezone.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=30) future_question = Question(pub_date=time) self.assertIs(future_question.was_published_recently(), False)

```

What we have done here is created a django.test.TestCase subclass with a method that creates a Question instance with a pub_date in the future. We then check the output of was_published_recently() - which ought to be False.

Running tests¶

In the terminal, we can run our test:

$ python manage.py test polls and you’ll see something like:

Creating test database for alias 'default'... System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

F
=

FAIL: test_was_published_recently_with_future_question (polls.tests.QuestionModelTests)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Traceback (most recent call last): File "/path/to/mysite/polls/tests.py", line 16, in test_was_published_recently_with_future_question self.assertIs(future_question.was_published_recently(), False) AssertionError: True is not False

---

Ran 1 test in 0.001s

FAILED (failures=1) Destroying test database for alias 'default'... What happened is this:

python manage.py test polls looked for tests in the polls application it found a subclass of the django.test.TestCase class it created a special database for the purpose of testing it looked for test methods - ones whose names begin with test in test_was_published_recently_with_future_question it created a Question instance whose pub_date field is 30 days in the future … and using the assertIs() method, it discovered that its was_published_recently() returns True, though we wanted it to return False The test informs us which test failed and even the line on which the failure occurred.

Fixing the bug¶

We already know what the problem is: Question.was_published_recently() should return False if its pub_date is in the future. Amend the method in models.py, so that it will only return True if the date is also in the past:

polls/models.py def was_published_recently(self): now = timezone.now() return now - datetime.timedelta(days=1) <= self.pub_date <= now and run the test again:

Creating test database for alias 'default'... System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

.
-

Ran 1 test in 0.001s

OK Destroying test database for alias 'default'... After identifying a bug, we wrote a test that exposes it and corrected the bug in the code so our test passes.

Many other things might go wrong with our application in the future, but we can be sure that we won’t inadvertently reintroduce this bug, because simply running the test will warn us immediately. We can consider this little portion of the application pinned down safely forever.

More comprehensive tests¶

While we’re here, we can further pin down the was_published_recently() method; in fact, it would be positively embarrassing if in fixing one bug we had introduced another.

Add two more test methods to the same class, to test the behavior of the method more comprehensively:

polls/tests.py def test_was_published_recently_with_old_question(self): """ was_published_recently() returns False for questions whose pub_date is older than 1 day. """ time = timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1, seconds=1) old_question = Question(pub_date=time) self.assertIs(old_question.was_published_recently(), False)

def test_was_published_recently_with_recent_question(self): """ was_published_recently() returns True for questions whose pub_date is within the last day. """ time = timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(hours=23, minutes=59, seconds=59) recent_question = Question(pub_date=time) self.assertIs(recent_question.was_published_recently(), True) And now we have three tests that confirm that Question.was_published_recently() returns sensible values for past, recent, and future questions.

Again, polls is a simple application, but however complex it grows in the future and whatever other code it interacts with, we now have some guarantee that the method we have written tests for will behave in expected ways.

Test a view¶

The polls application is fairly undiscriminating: it will publish any question, including ones whose pub_date field lies in the future. We should improve this. Setting a pub_date in the future should mean that the Question is published at that moment, but invisible until then.

A test for a view¶

When we fixed the bug above, we wrote the test first and then the code to fix it. In fact that was a simple example of test-driven development, but it doesn’t really matter in which order we do the work.

In our first test, we focused closely on the internal behavior of the code. For this test, we want to check its behavior as it would be experienced by a user through a web browser.

Before we try to fix anything, let’s have a look at the tools at our disposal.

The Django test client¶

Django provides a test Client to simulate a user interacting with the code at the view level. We can use it in tests.py or even in the shell.

We will start again with the shell, where we need to do a couple of things that won’t be necessary in tests.py. The first is to set up the test environment in the shell:

> > > from django.test.utils import setup_test_environment setup_test_environment() setup_test_environment() installs a template renderer which will allow us to examine some additional attributes on responses such as response.context that otherwise wouldn’t be available. Note that this method does not setup a test database, so the following will be run against the existing database and the output may differ slightly depending on what questions you already created. You might get unexpected results if your TIME_ZONE in settings.py isn’t correct. If you don’t remember setting it earlier, check it before continuing.

Next we need to import the test client class (later in tests.py we will use the django.test.TestCase class, which comes with its own client, so this won’t be required):

The list of polls shows polls that aren’t published yet (i.e. those that have a pub_date in the future). Let’s fix that.

In Tutorial 4 we introduced a class-based view, based on ListView:

polls/views.py class IndexView(generic.ListView): template_name = 'polls/index.html' context_object_name = 'latest_question_list'

```

def get_queryset(self): """Return the last five published questions.""" return Question.objects.order_by('-pub_date')\[:5]

```

We need to amend the get_queryset() method and change it so that it also checks the date by comparing it with timezone.now(). First we need to add an import:

polls/views.py from django.utils import timezone and then we must amend the get_queryset method like so:

polls/views.py def get_queryset(self): """ Return the last five published questions (not including those set to be published in the future). """ return Question.objects.filter( pub_date**lte=timezone.now() ).order_by('-pub_date')\[:5] Question.objects.filter(pub_date**lte=timezone.now()) returns a queryset containing Questions whose pub_date is less than or equal to - that is, earlier than or equal to - timezone.now.

Testing our new view¶

Now you can satisfy yourself that this behaves as expected by firing up the runserver, loading the site in your browser, creating Questions with dates in the past and future, and checking that only those that have been published are listed. You don’t want to have to do that every single time you make any change that might affect this - so let’s also create a test, based on our shell session above.

Add the following to polls/tests.py:

polls/tests.py from django.urls import reverse and we’ll create a shortcut function to create questions as well as a new test class:

polls/tests.py def create_question(question_text, days): """ Create a question with the given `question_text` and published the given number of `days` offset to now (negative for questions published in the past, positive for questions that have yet to be published). """ time = timezone.now() + datetime.timedelta(days=days) return Question.objects.create(question_text=question_text, pub_date=time)

class QuestionIndexViewTests(TestCase): def test_no_questions(self): """ If no questions exist, an appropriate message is displayed. """ response = self.client.get(reverse('polls:index')) self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200) self.assertContains(response, "No polls are available.") self.assertQuerysetEqual(response.context['latest_question_list'], [])

```

def test_past_question(self): """ Questions with a pub_date in the past are displayed on the index page. """ create_question(question_text="Past question.", days=-30) response = self.client.get(reverse('polls:index')) self.assertQuerysetEqual( response.context['latest_question_list'], ['<Question: Past question.>'] )

def test_future_question(self): """ Questions with a pub_date in the future aren't displayed on the index page. """ create_question(question_text="Future question.", days=30) response = self.client.get(reverse('polls:index')) self.assertContains(response, "No polls are available.") self.assertQuerysetEqual(response.context['latest_question_list'], [])

def test_future_question_and_past_question(self): """ Even if both past and future questions exist, only past questions are displayed. """ create_question(question_text="Past question.", days=-30) create_question(question_text="Future question.", days=30) response = self.client.get(reverse('polls:index')) self.assertQuerysetEqual( response.context['latest_question_list'], ['<Question: Past question.>'] )

def test_two_past_questions(self): """ The questions index page may display multiple questions. """ create_question(question_text="Past question 1.", days=-30) create_question(question_text="Past question 2.", days=-5) response = self.client.get(reverse('polls:index')) self.assertQuerysetEqual( response.context['latest_question_list'], ['<Question: Past question 2.>', '<Question: Past question 1.>'] )

```

Let’s look at some of these more closely.

First is a question shortcut function, create_question, to take some repetition out of the process of creating questions.

test_no_questions doesn’t create any questions, but checks the message: “No polls are available.” and verifies the latest_question_list is empty. Note that the django.test.TestCase class provides some additional assertion methods. In these examples, we use assertContains() and assertQuerysetEqual().

In test_past_question, we create a question and verify that it appears in the list.

In test_future_question, we create a question with a pub_date in the future. The database is reset for each test method, so the first question is no longer there, and so again the index shouldn’t have any questions in it.

And so on. In effect, we are using the tests to tell a story of admin input and user experience on the site, and checking that at every state and for every new change in the state of the system, the expected results are published.

Testing the DetailView¶

What we have works well; however, even though future questions don’t appear in the index, users can still reach them if they know or guess the right URL. So we need to add a similar constraint to DetailView:

polls/views.py class DetailView(generic.DetailView): ... def get_queryset(self): """ Excludes any questions that aren't published yet. """ return Question.objects.filter(pub_date\__lte=timezone.now()) And of course, we will add some tests, to check that a Question whose pub_date is in the past can be displayed, and that one with a pub_date in the future is not:

polls/tests.py class QuestionDetailViewTests(TestCase): def test_future_question(self): """ The detail view of a question with a pub_date in the future returns a 404 not found. """ future_question = create_question(question_text='Future question.', days=5) url = reverse('polls:detail', args=(future_question.id,)) response = self.client.get(url) self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 404)

```

def test_past_question(self): """ The detail view of a question with a pub_date in the past displays the question's text. """ past_question = create_question(question_text='Past Question.', days=-5) url = reverse('polls:detail', args=(past_question.id,)) response = self.client.get(url) self.assertContains(response, past_question.question_text)\`\`\`

Ideas for more tests¶

We ought to add a similar get_queryset method to ResultsView and create a new test class for that view. It’ll be very similar to what we have just created; in fact there will be a lot of repetition.

We could also improve our application in other ways, adding tests along the way. For example, it’s silly that Questions can be published on the site that have no Choices. So, our views could check for this, and exclude such Questions. Our tests would create a Question without Choices and then test that it’s not published, as well as create a similar Question with Choices, and test that it is published.

Perhaps logged-in admin users should be allowed to see unpublished Questions, but not ordinary visitors. Again: whatever needs to be added to the software to accomplish this should be accompanied by a test, whether you write the test first and then make the code pass the test, or work out the logic in your code first and then write a test to prove it.

At a certain point you are bound to look at your tests and wonder whether your code is suffering from test bloat, which brings us to:

When testing, more is better¶

It might seem that our tests are growing out of control. At this rate there will soon be more code in our tests than in our application, and the repetition is unaesthetic, compared to the elegant conciseness of the rest of our code.

It doesn’t matter. Let them grow. For the most part, you can write a test once and then forget about it. It will continue performing its useful function as you continue to develop your program.

Sometimes tests will need to be updated. Suppose that we amend our views so that only Questions with Choices are published. In that case, many of our existing tests will fail - telling us exactly which tests need to be amended to bring them up to date, so to that extent tests help look after themselves.

At worst, as you continue developing, you might find that you have some tests that are now redundant. Even that’s not a problem; in testing redundancy is a good thing.

As long as your tests are sensibly arranged, they won’t become unmanageable. Good rules-of-thumb include having:

a separate TestClass for each model or view a separate test method for each set of conditions you want to test test method names that describe their function Further testing¶

This tutorial only introduces some of the basics of testing. There’s a great deal more you can do, and a number of very useful tools at your disposal to achieve some very clever things.

For example, while our tests here have covered some of the internal logic of a model and the way our views publish information, you can use an “in-browser” framework such as Selenium to test the way your HTML actually renders in a browser. These tools allow you to check not just the behavior of your Django code, but also, for example, of your JavaScript. It’s quite something to see the tests launch a browser, and start interacting with your site, as if a human being were driving it! Django includes LiveServerTestCase to facilitate integration with tools like Selenium.

If you have a complex application, you may want to run tests automatically with every commit for the purposes of continuous integration, so that quality control is itself - at least partially - automated.

A good way to spot untested parts of your application is to check code coverage. This also helps identify fragile or even dead code. If you can’t test a piece of code, it usually means that code should be refactored or removed. Coverage will help to identify dead code. See Integration with coverage.py for details.
